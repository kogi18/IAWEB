\chapter{Animated Slideshow}

\label{chap:animated}

The biggest downside of the original rSlidy when compared to alternative solutions, with focus on well spread desktop solutions, would be its static state. Namely the presentation flow achieved with the application was an immediate switch between states or slides. Even the user interface was behaving similarly in a state-switching way. In the design changes the effects of hiding elements with hover and transition CSS elements also include a better user experience. This follows the observations from the web animation survey, also done by our group, were the importance of animation for user experience was stressed out. With knowledge gathered from the mentioned survey we enhanced both the user interface as well the presentation flow by incorporating animation with CSS and JavaScript.
