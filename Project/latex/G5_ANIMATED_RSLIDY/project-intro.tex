\chapter{Introduction}

\label{chap:Intro}

Our group was assigned with the task of refining the already existent presentation software \textit{rSlidy}. Therefore we first made some usability tests on our own in order to become familiar with the software and to find room for improvement. We interactively agreed with our instructor on features that needed implementation and those which would be nice to have, but not necessary.

The final submission comprises two versions of the new \textit{rSlidy}. One which is completely independent and one which uses two third party libraries. The independent one might not look as impressive in some scenarios, but is free of external code. The other version is arguably better design-wise, but relies on third party libraries, which was not in favor of the instructor. 

%HEre we tell we prepared a rSlidy only upgrade and a rSlidy supported by 3rd party software
