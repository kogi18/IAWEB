\chapter{Concluding Remarks}

\label{chap:Concl}

CSS LOC 800+
JS LOC 500+



Still room for improvement - Some tasks that were disscussed at the planning stage but deemd not needed in this stage

TypeScript for Grunt
Including Subheadings with in TOC on heading hover
Animated CSS text tyles
Canvas to actually draw on the slide - Marker support


Achieved better user experience for slide shows

Interesting problems
Same animation on same element cannot be triggered in subclass - either need additional element or reversed keframe

Element rendering knowledge is needed for animation planning - the display:none problem.

RWD testing should not be underestimated --- HERE Fernandos text

Javascript preloading and initialization tricky with HTML rendering
