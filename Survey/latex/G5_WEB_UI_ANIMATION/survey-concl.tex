\chapter{Concluding Remarks}

\label{chap:Concl}

Through the course of further investigating web animations, we realized that 
animations are not merely there to make a website appear more beautiful, but to 
carry meaning as well. So, if a user sees a hamburger icon, they should, and 
nowadays probably they do, know what this icon stands for. We showed many other 
useful applications for animation in web UI design, how we can achieve them 
with CSS, SVG and JS. Numerous examples of code show, how powerful CSS by 
istelf can be and how each addition on top of it enhances it, which makes it 
great for RWD development
