\chapter{Animation}

\label{chap:Animation}

{\em"Animation is defined as changing some property over time. On the other hand, motion is the act of moving or the process of being moved. . . .  To put it more simply, all motion is animation, but not all animation is motion."}\citep{head2016designing}
